# Introduction

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in biological data analysis, enabling researchers to uncover patterns, make predictions, and derive insights from complex datasets. The machine learning functions in this package are designed to facilitate the application of these techniques to genomic and proteomic data. These functions offer streamlined workflows for tasks such as:

Predicting Biomarkers: Leveraging machine learning models to identify key genes or proteins that distinguish between biological classes.

Clustering Samples: Using hierarchical clustering to group samples based on their expression profiles, revealing potential similarities or distinct patterns.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most informative genes or features for downstream analyses, optimizing the predictive power of datasets.

The tools provided are built with scalability and flexibility in mind, allowing integration with diverse machine learning libraries and workflows. By including these methods, the package enables you to unlock the potential of machine learning for hypothesis generation, biomarker discovery, and exploratory analysis.

# A) predict_biomarkers(): This function aims to use machine learning techniques to predict biomarkers from gene expression data. Currently, it is a placeholder for a future model (such as Random Forest or other classification algorithms). This function can be integrated with machine learning libraries to train and predict biomarkers based on gene expression data and sample labels.

## Example usage
```{r}
# Load example data
set.seed(32608)  
gene_data <- data.frame(
  Gene1 = rnorm(5),
  Gene2 = rnorm(5),
  Gene3 = rnorm(5)
)

# Create class labels for the samples
labels <- factor(c("Class1", "Class1", "Class2", "Class2", "Class1"))

# Predict biomarkers (Placeholder functionality)
biomarker_prediction <- predict_biomarkers(gene_data, labels)
print(biomarker_prediction)
```

# B) cluster_samples(): This function performs hierarchical clustering of the samples based on their gene expression profiles. The function returns the hierarchical clustering object, which can be visualized using dendrograms to see how samples group together.

## Example usage
```{r}
# Load example data
set.seed(32608) 
gene_data <- data.frame(
  Gene1 = rnorm(5),
  Gene2 = rnorm(5),
  Gene3 = rnorm(5)
)

# Cluster the samples based on their gene expression profiles
sample_clustering <- cluster_samples(gene_data)

# Plot the dendrogram of the clustering
plot(sample_clustering, main = "Hierarchical Clustering of Samples")
```

# C) feature_selection(): This function is designed to perform feature selection to identify the most significant genes from a dataset based on the sample labels. Currently, this is a placeholder for a specific feature selection method (e.g., using statistical tests, machine learning, or other techniques).

## Example usage:
```{r}
set.seed(32608)
gene_data <- data.frame(
  Gene1 = rnorm(5),
  Gene2 = rnorm(5),
  Gene3 = rnorm(5)
)

# Class labels for the samples
labels <- factor(c("Class1", "Class1", "Class2", "Class2", "Class1"))

# Perform feature selection (placeholder)
selected_features <- feature_selection(gene_data, labels)
print(selected_features)

```

## Conclusion

The machine_learning() functions offer essential tools for predictive modeling and clustering in biological data analysis. By utilizing techniques such as hierarchical clustering, feature selection, and future biomarker prediction, these functions enable the identification of patterns and important features in gene expression data. While some functions are placeholders for future enhancements, they provide a solid foundation for applying machine learning to biological datasets. These functions are key for advancing precision medicine, enabling the identification of potential biomarkers and the clustering of samples based on their molecular profiles, ultimately facilitating better decision-making in biological research.
